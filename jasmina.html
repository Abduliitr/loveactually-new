                <p><b>Jasmina Khanna</b>, quite a common name, just like the boy next door. But he is no ordinary person. Jasmina Khanna is the Virat Kohli of Indian Wheelchair Cricket Team under International Wheelchair Council by Disabled Supporting Society.
                <br>
                He is ranked the number one player in IWCC. Coming from humble backgrounds, Saurabh was born in a small town in Uttar Pradesh called Shamli. His father, Mr. Sanjeev Malik is a driver and his mother Mrs Pinki Malik is a housewife. He has a younger sister who is currently pursuing her second year and is a kickboxer. Saurabh’s father decided to shift to Delhi with his family in order to provide better education to his children. Saurabh completed his bachelors in Computer Science from IP University. He is currently doing his masters in Information Security from Ambedkar Institute of Advanced Communication Technologies and Research, Delhi.
                <br>
                Saurabh was diagnosed with polio in his left leg when he was six months old. At the age of five, he was operated, which allowed him to walk but with the help of a support.
                <br>
                Like any other Indian kid, Saurabh was also a cricket fanatic. Although burdened with a hindrance in his path, his steady determination, willpower, and perseverance never allowed his disability to come between him and his dream to become a cricketer. With his family’s constant support especially that of his father's, Saurabh was able to play at the  State and National levels and is now the shining star of the Indian Wheelchair Cricket Team.
                <br><br>
                To list a few of his numerous achievements:<br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">
                    1.Number 1 in  Asia ranking<br>
                </span>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">
                    2.Top run scorer in the series in Bangladesh<br>
                </span>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">
                    3.Top runscorer as an Indian batsman in Nepal<br>
                </span>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">
                    4.Man of the match in Mumbai<br>
                </span>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">
                    5.Man of the series in Uttarakhand<br>
                </span>
                
                A champion is defined not by his wins but how he can recover when he falls. Despite so many falls Saurabh used his weakness as his strength.
                It was in 2016 that Saurabh came to know about the Disabled Cricket team of Delhi through Facebook and subsequently gave trials for it in Agra. Since then Saurabh has played for the Delhi Wheelchair Cricket team. There has been no support from the government side for any matches conducted or for the practice sessions of the disabled team.
                <br><br>
                Even the BCCI has denied them recognition. They have been able to maintain the existence of their team and arrange matches with the help of the Disabled Society and NGOs but mostly have to arrange for private sponsors or spend from their own pockets. After the IWPL, the practice sessions of the Delhi Team have been sponsored by the Indian Spinal Injury for one year and they have their weekly practice at Indian Spinal Hospital, Vasant Kunj, Delhi. Because of these adversities, most players are doubtful about continuing their passion for Cricket and look for other jobs for survival.
                <br><br>
                Despite their breathtaking achievements, cricketers like Saurabh are highly neglected. They do more efforts than the others sports personalities even after being hindered by their disability but are still not catered to. It is the high time people like Saurabh are given their due recognition and respect. All he asks us is to do is recognize the Indian Wheelchair Cricket Team and show support to its players.
                What Saurabh had achieved despite all his limitation is something we all fail to achieve even though we have everything.
